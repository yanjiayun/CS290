    <h2>Assignment1</h2>
    <h2>Start at 04/08/2020</h2>
    <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3>
      <p>I had a big panic about the start of something new. I basically didn't know what to do, so I asked my friends who also major in CS.</p>
    <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I tried to use the structure in the lesson plan. You also learned the basics.</p>
    <h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Piazza, I search for keywords for specific questions to see if anyone on Piazza has asked a similar question and how they solved it.</li>
          <li>Lecture notes. Read the lecture note to get the basics.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Assignment2</h2>
      <h2>Start at 04/26/2020</h2>
      <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>There are so many different syntaxes in CSS that I had to look them up for the whole time while doing the homework.</p>
      <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
        <p>It strengthened my memory and familiarity with CSS syntax.</p>
      <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Google. Any thing I don't know or not sure about it, I'm used to using Google to find a solution or suggestion.</li>
            <li>Lecture notes. Read the lecture note to get the basic syntax. To be honest, that helps a lot.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>I looked up the usage and difference of some functions, such as "What's the difference between inline-block and flex" in display.</li>  
            <li>I used Google to search for specific questions, for example, "How to cancel the underline in CSS?"</li> 
          </ol>
