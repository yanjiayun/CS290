    <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3>
      <p>I had a big panic about the start of something new. I basically didn't know what to do, so I asked my friends who also major in CS.</p>
    <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I tried to use the structure in the lesson plan. You also learned the basics.</p>
    <h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Piazza, I search for keywords for specific questions to see if anyone on Piazza has asked a similar question and how they solved it.</li>
          <li>Lecture notes. Read the lecture note to get the basics.</li>
